# Logistic-Regression

This project is my introduction to logistic regression.

# Background and Motivation

Medical testing is often expensive and time consuming, not to mention unpleasant for the patient. In the 
case of heart disease, there are a number of tests which can be inconclusive on their own, from the 
noninvasive electrocardiogram (EKG), to blood draws, to the invasive procedure of cardiac catheterization. 
Using machine learning models to minimize testing and create more accurate diagnoses is beneficial to both 
the patient and the hospital. Costly testing is minimized and wait times for potentially more important tests 
decrease as fewer tests are required across the board.

What both the doctor and the patient care about is whether the patient has the disease. Since we are looking 
to find the binary outcome, “does the patient have heart disease,” from a set of independent variables 
ranging from patient age to EKG results, logistic regression the best choice. We can take basic information 
about the patient and noninvasive test results to output the answer quickly. This is extremely valuable when 
time is of the essence and if trained well enough, the model should outperform the accuracy of even the best 
doctors.

Note: Heart disease is a blanket term for several heart conditions. More specific logistic regression models 
should be made for more specific diagnoses.
